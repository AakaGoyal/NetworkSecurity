<h1>NetworkSecurity  </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Tasked to build a PoC network design for the new LAN topology and also  reconfigure the original network, within its current design, to minimize vulnerabilities taking  into consideration current guidance and best practices. 


**Requirements**

New LAN 
• All department traffic should be isolated from each other. 
• Security best practices applied at Layer 2. 
• HR should not be allowed to access the Accounting network. 
• Secure network for management of switches, only accessible by the IT devices in HQ. 
• All network devices should be secured following best practices. 
• Access to the Internet for Sales only 
• Accounting can only access the HQ network 
• Resilient links where appropriate 
Site to Site Networks 
• Implement appropriate security controls at Layer 3. 
Network Perimeter 
• All traffic entering the Corporate network should be secured. 
• Public traffic should only be able to access the CorpWeb Server. 
• All Internet traffic is via HQ 

**Part 1: Project**
Within the constraints of the current topology create a network design to demonstrate a 
solution in the selection and configuration of network security controls and measures for the 
above scenario. 
• New Secure LAN Design 
o Within the given packet tracer file, implement an appropriate secure LAN 
design for the new Branch office (BO) taking into consideration the security 
requirements detailed above. 
• Secure Current Network 
o Within the given packet tracer file, without changing the underlying topology 
reconfigure the original network devices for HQ and RO to take into 
consideration any incorrect configuration and security requirements detailed 
above.

**Part 2: Technical Report** 
Write a report containing a critical appraisal of the solution given in Part 1 evaluated against 
both current and emerging network attack vectors and the changing threat landscape.    
The report should: 
• defend the security controls, protocols, countermeasures and design technique 
recommendations and implications for development within these areas. 
• examine 3 critical security design issues that are still prevalent within the design and 
give recommendations on how these could be mitigated  
• acknowledge any financial implications for each of the above but it is not expected 
that detailed financial information is provided 
• Give a reflective evaluation of the implications of conducting this investigation and 
development for your learning on this programme

<h2>Tools & technologies used </h2>

Cisco Packet Tracer – for network simulation and design

VLANs – for network segmentation

SVI (Switched Virtual Interfaces) – for inter-VLAN routing

ACLs (Access Control Lists) – for traffic control and access restrictions

HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) – for gateway redundancy

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) – dynamic routing protocol

TACACS+ – centralized device authentication

SSH v2 – secure remote device access

SNMPv3 – secure network monitoring

DHCP Snooping – Layer 2 security

Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) – ARP spoofing protection

IPsec VPN – secure site-to-site connectivity

AAA Authentication – access control and user authentication

Banner Messages & Password Encryption – basic device hardening

Ansible / Puppet / Chef (recommended) – for automated configuration management

SIEM Tools (recommended) – for real-time security monitoring

WAF / IPS / DDoS Protection (recommended) – for enhanced perimeter security

802.1X (recommended) – for port-based access control

Zone-Based Firewall (ZBF) (mentioned as unsupported in old router)
